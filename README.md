This repository contains a Solidity smart contract demonstrating an insecure implementation of the transferOwnership function and its secure solution. The insecure version fails to handle the case where the current owner attempts to transfer ownership to themselves, leading to potential vulnerabilities. The secure version addresses this by adding a check to prevent self-ownership transfer.
